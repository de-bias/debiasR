## 0.0.0.9000

### Validation naming update

- The primary validation API now uses `validate_flow_overall()` for summary metrics and `validate_flow_pairs()` for row-level comparisons.
- The older names `validate_flow_benchmark()` and `validate_flow_all()` remain available as backwards-compatible aliases for one release cycle.
- The legacy `validate_flows()` helper has been removed.

### Migration notes

- Package documentation and onboarding now refer to `adjust_*` functions and `simulated_*` datasets consistently.
